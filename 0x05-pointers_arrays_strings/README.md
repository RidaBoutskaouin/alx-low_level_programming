This directory contains C programming language exercises focused on pointers, arrays, and strings. These concepts are fundamental to understanding and manipulating data in C, and mastering them will greatly enhance your programming skills.

### Files

The directory consists of the following files:

- `0-reset_to_98.c`: This file contains a C function that takes a pointer to an integer as a parameter and updates the value it points to 98.
- `1-swap.c`: In this file, you'll find a C function that swaps the values of two integers using pointers.
- `2-strlen.c`: Here, you'll find a C function that calculates the length of a string.
- `3-puts.c`: This file contains a C function that prints a string to the standard output followed by a new line.
- `4-print_rev.c`: In this file, you'll find a C function that prints a string in reverse.
- `5-rev_string.c`: Here, you'll find a C function that reverses a string.
- `6-puts2.c`: This file contains a C function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character.
- `7-puts_half.c`: In this file, you'll find a C function that prints the second half of a string.
- `8-print_array.c`: Here, you'll find a C function that prints elements of an array of integers.
- `9-strcpy.c`: This file contains a C function that copies the string pointed to by the source, including the terminating null byte, to the buffer pointed to by the destination.
- `100-atoi.c`: In this file, you'll find a C function that converts a string to an integer.
