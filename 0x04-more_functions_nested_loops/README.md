# 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops

## Description
This directory contains programs written in C as part of the "0x04-more_functions_nested_loops" project of the Holberton School curriculum. The programs in this directory focus on the usage of more functions and nested loops to solve various tasks.

## List of Files
Below are the files included in this directory along with their descriptions:

1. `0-isupper.c`: A function that checks for uppercase characters.
2. `1-isdigit.c`: A function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
3. `2-mul.c`: A function that multiplies two integers.
4. `3-print_numbers.c`: A function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9.
5. `4-print_most_numbers.c`: A function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9 (excluding 2 and 4).
6. `5-more_numbers.c`: A function that prints the numbers from 0 to 14 ten times.
7. `6-print_line.c`: A function that draws a straight line using the character `_`.
8. `7-print_diagonal.c`: A function that draws a diagonal line using the character `\`.
9. `8-print_square.c`: A function that prints a square using the character `#`.
10. `9-fizz_buzz.c`: A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, it prints "Fizz", for multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz", and for multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".
11. `10-print_triangle.c`: A function that prints a triangle using the character `#`.
12. `100-prime_factor.c`: A program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143.

## Requirements
- All programs are written in C.
- The code is compiled using `gcc 4.8.4` with the options `-Wall`, `-Werror`, `-Wextra`, `-std` and `-pedantic`.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory `0x04-more_functions_nested_loops`.
3. Compile the desired C file along with the necessary header files using the provided Makefile. For example, to compile `0-isupper.c`, use the command:\
`gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 <filename.c> -o <output_file>`

Replace `<filename.c>` with the name of the C file you want to compile (e.g., `0-isupper.c`) and `<output_file>` with the desired name for the output executable (e.g., `0-isupper`).
4. Run the compiled program. For example, if you compiled `0-isupper.c` and named the output executable `0-isupper`, use the following command:\n
./0-isupper
